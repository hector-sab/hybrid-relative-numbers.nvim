# hybrid-relative-numbers.nvim
A small plugin for setting an improved version of hybrid relative line numbers

# How to use it

In your `init.lua` you can set it as
```lua
require("hybrid-relative-numbers").activate_number_toggle()
```

Or manually enable it using `:HybridRelativeNumbersOn`

# ToDo
[ ] Add documentation. Really small tho.
[ ] Gif showcasing what this plugin is doing.
